Here are the requirements for a module:
* It just contain the variable $classname, which must be set to the name of a class defined within the module
* The class named by $classname must implement these methods:
	* getName() - returns the name of the module for logging purposes
	* handlesDirectCommands() - must return true if the module can be called by a command
	* if handlesDirectCommands() returns true:
		* getCommand() - returns the command that triggers this module
		* processCommand($fp, $line, $cmd) - processes the command contained in $cmd (which will be the array outputted by parse_cmd()), sending responses over $fp
	* handlesGlobalMessages() - must return true if the module is meant to process all chat messages
	* if handlesGlobalMessages() returns true:
		* processLine($fp, $line) - processes the line contained in $line (which will be the associative array outputted by parse_line()), sending responses over $fp
